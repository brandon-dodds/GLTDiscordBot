# kettenkrad-bot
This Discord bot is used to ping whenever a new episode of Girl's Last Tour is available in the Shoujo Shuumatsu Discord server!

# Development setup
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS BOT REQUIRES PYTHON 3.5 OR ABOVE!

In order to setup the bot for development and/or using for your Discord Server, you will need to install the Discord API for Python; this can be done by typing this into a terminal or powershell (assuming you have a python version > 3.5).

```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
After you have retrieved the Discord package that will have pulled some dependencies, you will need to execute the bot by doing this in the source folder:
```
python3 main.py
```
